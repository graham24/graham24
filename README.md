  Hi, my name is Graham and this is my personal GitHub profile. My GitHub has a small collection of personal projects, some just fun apps i have created, and some course I am working on or completed.

  The primary languages I have used are Javacript and PHP. I have also been learning React, as I see it as a important framwork to have a good idea of how to use.
